The IG also specifies transmission of other data documented in the EHR as part of the care of the patient which are also standardized, but are not routinely collected by cancer registries in the same way or as discrete items. Examples of these are procedures, medications, smoking, and vital signs (i.e., height, weight, BMI). Currently, software tools such as CDC’s eMaRC Plus parse some EHR elements and map or translate these fields to NAACCR items. However, some data are not able to be mapped to discrete items.

193,raceNapiia,Patient,"NAPIIA is an acronym for NAACCR Asian and Pacific Islander Identification Algorithm. Race--NAPIIA(derived API) recodes some single-race cases with a Race 1 [160] code of 96 to a more specific Asian race category, based on an algorithm that makes use of the birthplace and name fields (first, last, and maiden names). For single-race cases with a Race 1 code other than 96, it returns the Race 1 code. Multiple-race cases (those with information in Race 2 through Race 5, [161-164]) are handled variously; for greater detail please refer to the technical documentation: http://www.naaccr.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=3HnBhlmhkBs%3d&tabid=118&mid=458

In Version 1.1 of the algorithm, birthplace can be used to indirectly assign a specific race to one of eight Asian race groups (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Asian Indian, Filipino, Thai, and Cambodian), and names can be used to indirectly assign a specific race to one of seven Asian groups (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Asian Indian, Filipino, and Hmong). Subsequent versions of NAPIIA may incorporate Pacific Islanders and may potentially incorporate name lists for Thai, Cambodian, and Laotians."

1914,seerCauseSpecificCod,Tumor,"This variable was created for use in cause-specific survival and designates that the person died of their cancer.Adapted from http://seer.cancer.gov/causespecific/:Cause-specific survival is a net survival measure representing survival of a specified cause of death in the absence of other causes of death. Estimates are calculated by specifying the cause of death. Individuals who die of causes other than the specified cause are considered to be censored. This requires a cause of death variable that accurately captures all causes related to the specific cause. Vital records offices use algorithms to process causes of death from death certificates in order to identify a single, disease-specific, underlying cause of death. In some cases, attribution of a single cause of death may be difficult and misattribution may occur. For example a death may be attributed to the site of metastasis instead of the primary site.To capture deaths related to the specific cancer but not coded as such, the SEER cause-specific death classification variables are defined by taking into account causes of deaths in conjunction with tumor sequence (i.e., only one tumor or the first of subsequent tumors), site of the original cancer diagnosis, and comorbidities (e.g., AIDS and/or site-related diseases).The 'SEER cause-specific death classification' variable is used to obtain cancer-specific survival probability for a given cohort of cancer patients. Deaths attributed to the cancer of interest are treated as events and deaths from other causes are treated as censored observation. This variable is used in SEER*Stat cause-specific survival and crude probability of death using cause of death information."

380,sequenceNumberCentral,Tumor,"Code indicates the sequence of all reportable neoplasms over the lifetime of the person. This data item differs from Sequence Number-Hospital [560], because the definitions of reportable neoplasms often vary between a hospital and a central registry. Each neoplasm is assigned a different number. Sequence Number 00 indicates that the person has had only one in situ or one malignant neoplasm as defined by the Federal reportable list (regardless of central registry reference date). Sequence Number 01 indicates the first of two or more reportable neoplasms, but 02 indicates the second of two or more reportable neoplasms, and so on. Because the time period of Sequence Number is a person’s lifetime, reportable neoplasms not included in the central registry (those that occur outside the registry catchment area or before the reference date) also are allotted a sequence number. For example, a registry may contain a single record for a patient with a sequence number of 02 because the first reportable neoplasm preceded the central registry’s reference date.Reporting Requirements: Federally Required and State/Province Defined The Federal or SEER/NPCR standard defining the reportable neoplasms is described in Chapter III, Standards For Tumor Inclusion and Reportability. It is assumed that this shared standard is the “minimum” definition of reportability. Individual central cancer registries may define additional neoplasms as reportable.Numeric codes in the 00-59 range indicate the sequence of neoplasms of in situ or malignant behavior (2 or 3) at the time of diagnosis, which SEER/NPCR standards require to be reported. Codes 60 to 87 indicate the sequence of non-malignant tumors (as defined in Chapter III) and any other neoplasms that the central registry has defined as reportable. Neoplasms required by SEER/NPCR with an in situ or malignant behavior at the time of diagnosis are sequenced completely independently of this higher-numbered category. Sequence Number-Hospital does not affect Sequence Number-Central. The two notational systems are independent but central registries should take Sequence Number-Hospital [560] into account when coding Sequence Number Central. "
560,sequenceNumberHospital,Tumor,"Item indicates the sequence of all malignant and non-malignant neoplasms over the lifetime of the patient. The code may differ from the Sequence Number--Central [380] because the definitions of reportable neoplasms often vary between a hospital and a central registry. The two items also handle some types of tumors differently. Each neoplasm is assigned a different number. Sequence Number 00 indicates that the person has only one malignant neoplasm in his lifetime (regardless of hospital registry reference date). Sequence Number 01 indicates the first of two or more malignant neoplasms, while 02 indicates the second of two or more malignant neoplasms, and so on. Because the time period of Sequence Number is a person’s lifetime, reportable neoplasms not included in the hospital registry are also allotted a sequence number. For example, a registry may contain a single record for a patient with a sequence number of 02 because the first reportable neoplasm occurred before the hospital registry’s reference date. Similarly, Sequence Number 60 indicates the patient has only one non-malignant neoplasm, and Sequence Number 61 represents the first of multiple non-malignant neoplasms. Sequence numbers should be reassigned if the facility subsequently learns of an unaccessioned tumor that affects sequencing. Sequence Number-Central [380] does not affect Sequence Number-Hospital. The two notational systems are independent.Timing RuleIf two or more malignant tumors are diagnosed at the same time, the lowest sequence number will be assigned to the diagnosis with the worst prognosis. Likewise, if two or more non-malignant tumors are diagnosed at the same time, the lowest sequence number is assigned to the diagnosis with the worse prognosis. If no difference in prognosis is evident, the decision is arbitrary. "

If a patient has an Hispanic name, but there is reason to believe they are not Hispanic (e.g., the patient is Filipino, or the patient is a woman known to be non-Hispanic who has a Hispanic married name), the code in this field should be 0 (non-Spanish, non-Hispanic). The code in item Computed Ethnicity [200], however, would reflect the Hispanic name.Assign code 7 if Hispanic ethnicity is based strictly on a computer list or algorithm (unless contrary evidence is available) and also code in Computed Ethnicity [200]. See also Computed Ethnicity [200].Note: NAACCR recognizes that available definitions and abstracting instructions for Name--Last [2230] and Name--Maiden [2390] may be inadequate for describing names used in some cultures, including Hispanic cultures. Explicit instructions have not been provided for entering compound names, with or without hyphens or “De.” Order of names, use of maternal and paternal names, and use of hyphens can vary across cultures. It is likely that abstracting and coding practice for these items varies across registries. Limitations inherent in these definitions should be kept in mind when using the data."
