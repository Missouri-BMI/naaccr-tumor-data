It is possible to separate Hispanic ancestral subgroups (e.g., Mexican) when indirect assignment results from birthplace information but not from surname match. The algorithm uses the following standard variables: Spanish/Hispanic Origin [190], Name--Last [2230], Name--Maiden [2390], Birthplace [250], Race 1 [160], IHS Link [192], and Sex [220].Code 7 (Spanish surname only) of the Spanish/Hispanic Origin [190] data item became effective with 1994 diagnoses. It is recommended that NHIA should be run on 1995 and later diagnoses. However, a central registry may run it on their data for prior years.

Race--NAPIIA(derived API) recodes some single-race cases with a Race 1 [160] code of 96 to a more specific Asian race category, based on an algorithm that makes use of the birthplace and name fields (first, last, and maiden names). For single-race cases with a Race 1 code other than 96, it returns the Race 1 code. Multiple-race cases (those with information in Race 2 through Race 5, [161-164]) are handled variously; for greater detail please refer to the technical documentation: http://www.naaccr.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=3HnBhlmhkBs%3d&tabid=118&mid=458

In Version 1.1 of the algorithm, birthplace can be used to indirectly assign a specific race to one of eight Asian race groups (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Asian Indian, Filipino, Thai, and Cambodian), and names can be used to indirectly assign a specific race to one of seven Asian groups (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Asian Indian, Filipino, and Hmong).

The ACS publishes tract-level poverty data annually, on a rolling five-year window, with a two-year lag (e.g., poverty data for 2006-2010 will be available in 2012). Cases for a given diagnosis year are initially coded using the most recent file available when the cancer data are first released, and the item is subsequently coded using the ACS file centered on the year of diagnosis. For example, cases diagnosed in 2012 will initially be coded using the 2008-2012 ACS file, and two years later using the 2010-2014 ACS file. An exception to this rule is that cases diagnosed in 2005 and 2006 will be coded using the 2005-2009 ACS file, because this was the first such file released.

This data item differs from Sequence Number-Hospital [560], because the definitions of reportable neoplasms often vary between a hospital and a central registry. Each neoplasm is assigned a different number. Sequence Number 00 indicates that the person has had only one in situ or one malignant neoplasm as defined by the Federal reportable list (regardless of central registry reference date). Sequence Number 01 indicates the first of two or more reportable neoplasms, but 02 indicates the second of two or more reportable neoplasms, and so on. Because the time period of Sequence Number is a person’s lifetime, reportable neoplasms not included in the central registry (those that occur outside the registry catchment area or before the reference date) also are allotted a sequence number. For example, a registry may contain a single record for a patient with a sequence number of 02 because the first reportable neoplasm preceded the central registry’s reference date.Reporting Requirements: Federally Required and State/Province Defined The Federal or SEER/NPCR standard defining the reportable neoplasms is described in Chapter III, Standards For Tumor Inclusion and Reportability. It is assumed that this shared standard is the “minimum” definition of reportability. Individual central cancer registries may define additional neoplasms as reportable.Numeric codes in the 00-59 range indicate the sequence of neoplasms of in situ or malignant behavior (2 or 3) at the time of diagnosis, which SEER/NPCR standards require to be reported. Codes 60 to 87 indicate the sequence of non-malignant tumors (as defined in Chapter III) and any other neoplasms that the central registry has defined as reportable. Neoplasms required by SEER/NPCR with an in situ or malignant behavior at the time of diagnosis are sequenced completely independently of this higher-numbered category. Sequence Number-Hospital does not affect Sequence Number-Central.

Nonanalytic cases (codes 30-49 and 99) may be abstracted by the facility to meet central registry requirements or because of a request by the facility’s cancer program. Nonanalytic cases are grouped according to the reason a patient who received care at the facility is nonanalytic, or the reason a patient who never received care at the facility may have been abstracted.

Estimates are calculated by specifying the cause of death. Individuals who die of causes other than the specified cause are considered to be censored. This requires a cause of death variable that accurately captures all causes related to the specific cause. Vital records offices use algorithms to process causes of death from death certificates in order to identify a single, disease-specific, underlying cause of death. In some cases, attribution of a single cause of death may be difficult and misattribution may occur. For example a death may be attributed to the site of metastasis instead of the primary site.To capture deaths related to the specific cancer but not coded as such, the SEER cause-specific death classification variables are defined by taking into account causes of deaths in conjunction with tumor sequence (i.e., only one tumor or the first of subsequent tumors), site of the original cancer diagnosis, and comorbidities (e.g., AIDS and/or site-related diseases).The 'SEER cause-specific death classification' variable is used to obtain cancer-specific survival probability for a given cohort of cancer patients.
