While Accession Number-Hosp [550] is subject to change, the Patient System ID-Hosp number is created and maintained by the hospital tumor registry's software system, and requires no key entry. Because the Patient System ID-Hosp number is unchanging, it affords an absolute linkage between a hospital patient record and a central registry's patient record.

This provides a stable identifier to link back to all reported tumors for a patient. It also serves as a reliable linking identifier; useful when central registries send follow-up information back to hospitals. Other identifiers such as social security number and medical record number, while useful, are subject to change and are thus less useful for this type of record linkage.

Reference to Census 2000 definitions for ethnicity and race: http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf2.pdf

All information resources should be used to determine the correct code, including:
Stated ethnicity in the medical record
Stated Hispanic origin on the death certificate
Birthplace
Information about life history and/or language spoken found during the abstracting process
Patient's last name [2230] or maiden name [2390] found on a list of Hispanic names.

Some registries code the information from the medical record, others code ethnicity based on Spanish names, and others use a combination of methods.

Persons of Spanish or Hispanic origin may be of any race, but these categories generally are not used for Native Americans, Filipinos, etc., who may have Spanish names. If a patient has an Hispanic name, but there is reason to believe they are not Hispanic (e.g., the patient is Filipino, or the patient is a woman known to be non-Hispanic who has a Hispanic married name), the code in this field should be 0 (non-Spanish, non-Hispanic). The code in item Computed Ethnicity [200], however, would reflect the Hispanic name.

Assign code 7 if Hispanic ethnicity is based strictly on a computer list or algorithm (unless contrary evidence is available) and also code in Computed Ethnicity [200]. 

See also Computed Ethnicity [200].

Note: NAACCR recognizes that available definitions and abstracting instructions for Name--Last [2230] and Name--Maiden [2390] may be inadequate for describing names used in some cultures, including Hispanic cultures. Explicit instructions have not been provided for entering compound names, with or without hyphens or ""De."" Order of names, use of maternal and paternal names, and use of hyphens can vary across cultures. It is likely that abstracting and coding practice for these items varies across registries. Limitations inherent in these definitions should be kept in mind when using the data.

See the rationales for the Race 1-5 [160-164] and Computed Ethnicity [200]. Ethnic origin has a significant association with cancer rates and outcomes. Hispanic populations have different patterns of occurrence of cancer from other populations that may be included in the ""white"" category of Race [160]...

It is possible to separate Hispanic ancestral subgroups (e.g., Mexican) when indirect assignment results from birthplace information but not from surname match. The algorithm uses the following NAACCR standard variables: Spanish/Hispanic Origin [190], Name-Last [2230], Name-Maiden [2390], Birthplace [250], Race 1 [160], and Sex [220]. Code 7 (Spanish surname only) of the Spanish/Hispanic Origin [190] data item became effective with 1994 diagnosis. It is recommended that NHIA should be run on 1995 and forward diagnosis. However, a central registry may run it on their data for prior years.

Sometimes despite best efforts to obtain complete information directly from the medical record, information is not available and is reported to the cancer registry as a missing data item. With regard to Hispanic ethnicity, some cancer registries have found it necessary to rely on indirect methods to populate this data element. The registries often have significant numbers or proportions of Hispanic populations in their jurisdiction.

Race--NAPIIA recodes some single-race cases with a Race 1 [160] code of 96 to a more specific Asian race category, based on an algorithm that makes use of the birthplace and name fields (first, last, and maiden names). For single-race cases with Race 1 other than 96, it returns Race 1. Multiple-race cases (those with information in Race 2 through Race 5, [161-164]) are handled variously; refer to the technical documentation for specifics: www.naaccr.org/filesystem/pdf/NAPIIA_v1_ 07242007.pdf.

In Version 1 of the algorithm, birth place can be used to indirectly assign a specific race to one of eight Asian race groups (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Asian Indian, Filipino, Thai, and Cambodian), and names can be used to indirectly assign a specific race to one of seven Asian groups (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Asian Indian, Filipino, and Hmong). Subsequent versions of NAPIIA may incorporate Pacific Islanders and may potentially incorporate name lists for Thai, Cambodian, and Laotians.

The use of more specific Asian and Pacific Islander codes will enhance surveillance and research activities focused on specific API subgroups.

This data item differs from Sequence Number--Hospital [560], because the definitions of reportable neoplasms often vary between a hospital and a central registry. Each neoplasm is assigned a different number. Sequence Number 00 indicates that the person has had only one in situ or one malignant neoplasm as defined by the Federal reportable list (regardless of central registry reference date). Sequence Number 01 indicates the first of two or more reportable neoplasms, while 02 indicates the second of two or more reportable neoplasms, and so on. Because the time period of Sequence Number is a person's lifetime, reportable neoplasms not included in the central registry (those that occur outside the registry catchment area or before the reference date) also are allotted a sequence number. For example, a registry may contain a single record for a patient with a sequence number of 02 because the first reportable neoplasm preceded the central registry's reference date. Reporting Requirements: Federally Required and State/Province Defined The Federal or SEER/NPCR standard defining which neoplasms are reportable is described in Chapter III, Standards For Tumor Inclusion and Reportability. It is assumed that this shared standard is the ""minimum"" definition of reportability. Individual central cancer registries may define additional neoplasms as reportable. Numeric codes in the 00-35 range indicate the sequence of neoplasms of in situ or malignant behavior (2 or 3) at the time of diagnosis, which SEER/NPCR standards require to be reported. Codes 60 to 87 indicate the sequence of non-malignant tumors (as defined in Chapter III) and any other neoplasms that the central registry has defined as reportable. Neoplasms required by SEER/NPCR with an in situ or malignant behavior at the time of diagnosis are sequenced completely independently of this higher-numbered category. Sequence Number-Hospital does not affect Sequence Number-Central. The two notational systems are independent but central registries should take Sequence Number-Hospital [560] into account when coding Sequence Number Central. Timing Rule The sequence number may change over the lifetime of the patient. If an individual previously diagnosed with a single reportable malignant neoplasm is subsequently diagnosed with a second reportable malignant neoplasm, the sequence code for the first neoplasm changes from 00 to 01. A central registry might also discover that an individual with one or more known neoplasms had an earlier reportable neoplasm that had been unknown to the registry. Typically, a re-evaluation of all related sequence numbers is required whenever an additional neoplasm is identified. If two or more reportable neoplasms are diagnosed at the same time, the lowest sequence number is to be assigned to the diagnosis with the worst prognosis. If no difference in prognosis is evident, the decision is arbitrary. Timing rules for sequencing neoplasms coded in the 60-87 range are the same as timing rules for sequencing of required in situ or malignant neoplasms. If a registry collects any central registry-defined neoplasms, the codes 60-87 should be used. The codes 60-87 also should be used for non-malignant tumor diagnosed on or after January 1, 2004. Timing rules for sequencing these neoplasms are the same as timing rules for sequencing of required in situ or invasive neoplasms.

The purpose of sequencing based on the patient's lifetime is to truly identify the 00s, the people who only had one malignant primary in their lifetimes for survival analysis. If a central registry sequences by just what is reported to them, then it will be unclear whether 00 means the person only had one malignant primary in his lifetime or the person had one malignant primary since the central registry started collecting data. The Federally required reportable list has changed throughout the years, so the registry must use the appropriate reportable list for the year of diagnosis.

Do not include cases where a definite statement of malignancy is made within two months following the original/initial diagnosis. (This does not include the use of ambiguous terminology from cancer screening followed by a positive cancer confirmation that is follow-up to the screening.) 

Cases include reportable cancer diagnoses (by any method including death certificate only and autopsy only) based only on ambiguous terminology. There is no conclusive diagnosis (positive clinical diagnosis, pathology, etc.) within two months of the original diagnosis that will further qualify the ambiguous term (no longer based on ambiguous terminology). 

Ambiguous terminology may originate from any source document, such as pathology report, radiology report, or from a clinical report. 

This data item is used only when ambiguous terminology is used to establish diagnosis. It is not used when ambiguous terminology is used to clarify a primary site, specific histology, histologic group, or stage of disease.

Follow-back to a physician or subsequent readmission (following the initial two month diagnosis period) may eventually confirm a cancer diagnosis (conclusive cancer diagnosis greater than two months after date of initial diagnosis that was based on ambiguous terminology). 

These cases should be excluded from case selection in research studies and from annual contact (i.e., follow-up) by registrars. Direct patient contact is not recommended for these cases.

Cases with a reportable cancer diagnosis that has been established based only on reports that contain ambiguous terminology to describe final diagnostic findings cannot currently be identified. 

Multiple surveys have identified a lack of consensus in the interpretation and use of ambiguous terms across physician specialties. These cases may or may not have an actual cancer diagnosis based on clinician, radiologist, and pathologist review. 

Furthermore, the historical interpretation and use of ambiguous terms by cancer registrars and registries has not been consistent or compatible with physician use of these terms. 

This data item will identify specific primary sites where the ambiguous terminology is commonly used to describe or establish a cancer diagnosis. 

Data collected will be used as the basis for modifications to case inclusion and reportable rules following complete analysis and impact assessment.

The code in this field can be used to explain why information may be incomplete on a tumor. For example, death certificate only cases have unknown values for many data items, so one may want to exclude them from some analyses. The field also is used to monitor the success of non-hospital case reporting and follow-back mechanisms. All population-based registries should have some death certificate-only cases where no hospital admission was involved, but too high a percentage can imply both shortcomings in case-finding and that follow-back to uncover missed hospital reports was not complete. Coding Instructions Code in the following priority order: 1, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7. This is a change to reflect the addition of codes 2 and 8 and to prioritize laboratory reports over nursing home reports. The source facilities included in the previous code 1 (hospital inpatient and outpatient) are split between codes 1, 2, and 8. This data item is intended to indicate the completeness of information available to the abstractor. Reports from health plans (e.g., Kaiser, Veterans Administration, military facilities) in which all diagnostic and treatment information is maintained centrally and is available to the abstractor are expected to be at least as complete as reports for hospital inpatients, which is why these sources are grouped with inpatients and given the code with the highest priority. Sources coded with '2' usually have complete information on the cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Sources coded with '8' would include, but would not be limited to, outpatient surgery and nuclear medicine services. A physician's office that calls itself a surgery center should be coded as a physician's office. Surgery centers are equipped and staffed to perform surgical procedures under general anesthesia.

This item differs from the Sequence Number--Central [380] because the definitions of reportable neoplasms often vary between a hospital and a central registry. Each neoplasm is assigned a different number. Sequence Number 00 indicates that the person has only one malignant neoplasm in his lifetime (regardless of hospital registry reference date). Sequence Number 01 indicates the first of two or more malignant neoplasms, while 02 indicates the second of two or more malignant neoplasms, and so on. Because the time period of Sequence Number is a person's lifetime, reportable neoplasms not included in the hospital registry are also allotted a sequence number. For example, a registry may contain a single record for a patient with a sequence number of 02 because the first reportable neoplasm occurred before the hospital registry's reference date. Similarly, Sequence Number 60 indicates the patient has only one non-malignant neoplasm, and Sequence Number 61 represents the first of multiple non-malignant neoplasms.

Reporting Requirements: COC, State/Province, and The Hospital Cancer Committee 
The COC standard defining which neoplasms are reportable is described in Chapter III, Standards For Case Inclusion and Reportability; it is assumed that this standard is the ""minimum"" definition of reportability. In addition to the COC-required reportable neoplasms, hospital cancer registries have to meet the reporting requirements of the central cancer registry and the hospital cancer committee. These neoplasms often are called ""reportable by agreement"" in COC publications. Any tumor in the patient's past that is reportable or reportable-by-agreement must be taken into account when sequencing subsequently accessioned tumors. Sequence numbers should be reassigned if the facility subsequently learns of an unaccessioned tumor that affects sequencing. Sequence Number-Central [380] does not affect Sequence Number-Hospital. The two notational systems are independent.

Timing Rule
If two or more malignant tumors are diagnosed at the same time, the lowest sequence number will be assigned to the diagnosis with the worst prognosis. Likewise, if two or more non-malignant tumors are diagnosed at the same time, the lowest sequence number is assigned to the diagnosis with the worse prognosis. If no difference in prognosis is evident, the decision is arbitrary... NAACCR Data Standards and Data Dictionary Version 11"

Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package Multiple versions of edits of the type Primary site, Morphology-Type check for ""usual"" combinations of site and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology. The SEER version of the edit is more restrictive than the COC edit, and thus uses a different over-ride flag. The COC version of the edit will accept Over-ride COC-Site/Type or Over-ride Site/Type as equivalent. The Site/Histology validation list (available on the SEER web site) contains those histologies commonly found in the specified primary site. Histologies that occur only rarely or never are not included. These edits require review of all combinations not listed. Since basal and squamous cell carcinomas of non-genital skin sites are not reportable to SEER, these site/histology combinations do not appear on the SEER validation list. For the COC version of the edit, if Primary Site is in the rage C440-C449 (skin), and Histologic Type ICD-O-3 is in the range 8000-8005 (neoplasms, malignant, NOS), 8010-8046 (epithelial carcinomas), 8050-8084 (papillary and squamous cell carcinomas), or 8090-8110 (basal cell carcinomas), no further editing is done. No over-ride is necessary for these cases in the COC version of the edit. Review of these cases requires investigating whether a) the combination is biologically implausible, or b) there are cancer registry coding conventions that would dictate different codes for the diagnosis.

Some edits check for code combinations that are possible, but quite rare. If the code combination generates an error message and review of the case indicates that the codes are correct for the case, then the over-ride flag is used to skip the edit in the future. See Chapter IV, Recommended Data Edits and Software Coordination of Standards. Over-ride Flags as Used in the EDITS Software Package Edits of the type Diagnostic Confirmation, Behavior Code differ in the use of ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 and check that, for in situ cases (Behavior = 2), Diagnostic Confirmation specifies microscopic confirmation (1, 2, or 4). The distinction between in situ and invasive is very important to a registry, since prognosis is so different. Since the determination that a neoplasm has not invaded surrounding tissues, i.e., in situ, is made microscopically, cases coded in situ in behavior should have a microscopic confirmation code. However, very rarely, a physician will designate a case noninvasive or in situ without microscopic evidence. If an edit of the type, Diagnostic Confirmation, Behavior Code, gives an error message or warning, check that Behavior and Diagnostic Confirmation have been coded correctly. Check carefully for any cytologic or histologic evidence that may have been missed in coding. The following histologies are not accepted as in situ: 8000-8005, 8020, 8021, 8331, 8320, 8800-9055, 9062, 9082, 9083, 9110-9493, 9501-9989. Edits of the type, Morphology--Type/Behavior, perform the following check: Codes listed in ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 with behavior codes of only 0 or 1 are considered valid, since the behavior matrix of ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3 allows for the elevation of the behavior of such histologies when the tumor is in situ or malignant. This edit forces review of these rare cases to verify that they are indeed in situ or malignant. If a Morphology-Type/Behavior edit produces an error or warning message and the case is one in which the 4-digit morphology code is one that appears in ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 only with behavior codes of 0 or 1, verify the coding of morphology and that the behavior should be coded malignant or in situ. The registrar may need to consult a pathologist or medical advisor in problem cases. Exceptions: If year of Date of Diagnosis > 2000, then a behavior code of 1 is valid for the following ICD-O-2 histologies and no over-ride flag is needed: 8931, 9393, 9538, 9950, 9960-9962, 9980-9984, and 9989. Similarly, the following ICD-O-3 histologies are valid with a behavior code of 1: 8442, 8451, 8462, 8472, and 8473.

It is based on and replaces EOD--Tumor size [780]. For most sites, CS Tumor Size is used to record the largest dimension, or the diameter of the primary tumor in millimeters (for example: 1 mm = 001, 1 cm = 010). See the CS schemes for site-specific variants. For many sites, the CS algorithm uses this data item to derive the Derived AJCC T [2940] according to the sixth edition of AJCC Cancer Staging Manual.

CS is a group of data items set up by a joint task force including representatives from SEER, ACoS, CDC, NAACCR, NCRA, and AJCC, designed to provide a single uniform set of codes and rules for coding EOD/ stage information to meet the needs of all of the participating standard setters. CS incorporates all of the fields from SEER 10-digit EOD, in a modified form, and adds several additional fields. When CS data items are coded, a computer algorithm allows generation of AJCC Sixth Edition TNM stage, SEER Summary Stage 1977, and SEER Summary Stage 2000. Separate CS fields are provided in the NAACCR record for these outputs.
